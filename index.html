              <p>This project was one of my first fully designed websites, it was a conceptual piece for a fictitious high end restaurant based in York. It taught me how to make an animated hamburger menu as well as some interesting hover effects over the menus. The site was made purely with HTML and CSS as no Javascript was required for functionality.</p>

              <p>This was my largest project to date and definitely the most complex. The links below only show an example of the homepage rather than the full website due to privacy however the main website had a lot more features. <br>First there was the working login system, all guests were issued a unique ID which personalises the experience such as welcome message. <br>Second I needed our guests to be able to RSVP via the website which emails our dedicated email address. <br>The third main feature was the gallery, here I allowed the users to upload photos from the website which once approved showed in a grid format.</p>

            <p>Hi my name is Harry Thrall, I am a front-end web developer, specialising in HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>
            <p>I graduated from the University of York in 2018 with a Master's Degree in Information Technology. With a strong knowledge of Java behind me I pushed myself to learn new skills and expand my programming knowledge. It was here my passion for web development began. I quickly realised how much I enjoyed taking my projects from a rough sketch in my notepad, to a fully fledged working website. For my larger projects such as the wedding website I organise my requirements using Trello which allows me to see what functionality I haave completed and what I still have to add. </p>
            <p>I still have a lot to learn on this journey but I think with programming you never stop learning, be it new frameworks, new techniques or even new languages altogether but the ever changing nature is what makes this field so exciting.</p>
